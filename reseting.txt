Discord doesn't have a way to reset the bot's token via the API so it seems that the only way is to put them in a public github repo.

if your bot is here, please make sure that you are more careful with it: do not put it in a public Glitch project or git repo!!

this repo exists only to reset leaked tokens. Discord should auto-reset all tokens committed to GitHub; if it doesn't work, then that was not my intention.
